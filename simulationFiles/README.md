# SIMULATION FILES

- This folder contains the simulation files designed in Simulink (using MATLAB R2022a version).
- These simulations derive the component values from MATLAB workspace and thus you need to execute the script available in the repository before running the simulation.
- Please read the README file in the main folder to know more about the design process.
